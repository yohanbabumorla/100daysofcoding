🚀 100 Days of Code: Days 64-66

LeetCode Journey Begins!

After mastering array fundamentals, I dove into LeetCode! Solved 5 problems and discovered the power of optimization techniques.

📅 Day 64: Building Momentum

Concatenation of Array Simple but effective - used Python's += operator for clean array concatenation.

Time: O(n) | Space: O(n)

Running Sum of 1D Array First exposure to prefix sum! Modified array in-place instead of creating new one.

Time: O(n) | Space: O(1) ✨

📅 Day 65: Two-Pointer Breakthrough

Move Zeroes Used two-pointer technique to move zeros to end while maintaining order. In-place swapping made it space-efficient!

Time: O(n) | Space: O(1)

Key Insight: Two pointers eliminate the need for extra arrays!

📅 Day 66: Two Sum - Two Approaches

Two Sum (Unsorted) Started with brute force nested loops.

Time: O(n²) | Space: O(1)

Two Sum II (Sorted Array) Same problem, sorted input - used two-pointer technique!
Time: O(n) | Space: O(1) 🎯

Game-Changer: Sorting enables optimization from O(n²) to O(n)!

💡 Key Learnings

✅ Two-pointer technique is a pattern, not just a trick 
✅ In-place modification saves space 
✅ Problem constraints change optimal solutions 
✅ Brute force first, then optimize
